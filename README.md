# Bessa Group Cookiecutter Python repository template


| [**GitHub**](https://github.com/bessagroup/cookiecutter-bessapypackage) |

**First publication:** July 31, 2025

***

## Summary

This repository serves as a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) template for Python code.
Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from project templates, e.g., Python packages. It is a great way to quickly set up a new Python package with a standard structure and best practices, and it replaces the need to manually create the boilerplate code for a new Python package.

Upon running the template, it will prompt you for some information about your new package, such as the package name, author name, and email address. After you provide this information, Cookiecutter will generate a new directory with the structure of a Python package.

The template is compliant to the [Bessa Research Group Python Development Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bessagroup/python_code_of_conduct). This template is adopted from the [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) template by Audrey M. Roy Greenfeld.
## Statement of need

Members of the Bessa Research Group can use this cookiecutter template to create new Python repositories. The template is compliant to the [Bessa Research Group Python Development Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bessagroup/python_code_of_conduct).
